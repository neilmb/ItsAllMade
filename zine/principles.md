# ItsAllMade zine

_It's All Made_ is a printed zine to explore a practice for local, small-scale, human-oriented exchange of ideas and information.

In the first quarter of the twenty-first century, information exchange is predominantly mediated by commercial entities who provide communications as an enticement to their real business of selling advertisements. In an effort to fight back against this process of commodification that elides the bedrock reality that everything is made somehow by someone, this zine is a handmade artifact of asynchronous communication and cultural creation.

It is (1) imperfect. Things made by people (not corporations) are products of craftsmanship from people with evolving skills. These imperfections are part of the meta-communication that comes with using an explicitly handmade method.

It is (2) evolving. Change is a hallmark of natural systems. Evolution scrutinizes improvements for their fitness and keeps the things that work well and moves on from the things that don't.

It is (3) for a specific group of people in a specific place. Corporate communication pretends that our ideas can and should travel worldwide, but this is not consistent with human-scale systems.

The prerequisite for evolving, handmade, human-scale projects to survive and thrive is feedback. When humans interact, the information flows in both directions. One person speaks, but they register back from another person reams of verbal and non-verbal information that shapes the ongoing conversation. Ideally, the same return flow of information can happen here.
